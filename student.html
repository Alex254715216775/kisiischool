            <p>The Kisii School is a full boarding school.<br>The Principal and most of the teachers are housed within <br>the compound.</p>
            <p>The school presently accommodates the students<br>in eight dormitories (houses). Each of the existing<br>dormitories/houses is managed by<br>a housemaster.</p>
